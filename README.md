## Player Guidelines for Discord Games

* Downloading, copy-pasting, or taking screenshots of any system messages from the bot is forbidden, even if you do not plan on sharing it with others. If you believe a piece of information is important to remember, write it down on paper, type it out, or use your memory.
* Outside of the Day Phase, discussing character abilities and choice of targets, with the intention of coordinating night actions between players, is forbidden. You are however free to talk about any other aspect of the game, such as impressions from scum reading or logical deductions.
* Privately messaging other players or contacting them about the game through a medium that is outside of the whispering function of the bot or the public gameplay channels of the server is forbidden.
* Meta-gaming is forbidden. This includes but is not limited to using known bot bugs or features to aid your deductions, using elements irrelevant to the game (such as being AFK) to support an argument in game, and quizzing players based on the content of their private bot instructions in order to confirm their character claim.
* Intentionally waiting for timeouts to avoid acting out your night abilities is forbidden. This however does not apply to nominations and trials during the Day Phase.
* Before joining, it is your responsibility to make sure that your nickname consists exclusively of alphanumerical characters and does not interfere with the formatting of bot messages. Your nickname must also remain the same throughout the game.
* The bot is only a tool to facilitate gameplay. Some parts of the game require the players to follow a code of honour even when there is not specified action that the bot will take in response to a player breaking a rule, such as the butler not voting with their master.
